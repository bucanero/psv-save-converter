# ps3-psvresigner
by [@dots_tb](https://github.com/dots-tb) - Resigns non-console specific PS3 PSV savefiles. PSV files embed PS1 and PS2 save data. This program does not inject save files and only signs!
With help from the CBPS (https://discord.gg/2nDCbxJ) , especially:

## Usage:

Drag and drop a modified PSV PSOne or PS2 save file onto the program. It will resign it so that you may use with your PS3 through USB.

Or use CMD:
	./ps3-psvresigner <savefile.PSV>
